# Introduction
Envision is an innovative mobile application designed to assist high school students in documenting their extracurricular activities. The app serves as a digital portfolio, enabling students to log, manage, and share their achievements. It is available on both web and mobile platforms, providing flexibility and convenience for all users.

## Student Functionality
Students can log in to their accounts using a designated passkey, which is set to "1234" for testing purposes. Once logged in, they can input and describe activities they have participated in under six different categories: Academic Achievements, Sports, Arts, Volunteering, Clubs, and Miscellaneous. All data is stored dynamically through a cloud-based dataset, ensuring it is secure and accessible from any device.

The app generates comprehensive portfolio reports for each category of activity. These reports can be viewed and downloaded, and students can upload them directly to Instagram and LinkedIn, showcasing their achievements to a broader audience.

## Administrator Functionality
Administrators have secure access using a separate passkey (currently "1234"). They can view and edit the portfolios of all students, ensuring the accuracy of the information and monitoring student progress effectively.

## Technical Details
HS Portfolio Creator is available as a mobile app on iOS and Android, and as a web application. The backend utilizes Firebase Firestore for dynamic and secure data storage, while the frontend is built using SwiftUI for iOS, Kotlin for Android, and React for the web application. Authentication is managed through Firebase Authentication to ensure secure login processes for both students and administrators.
