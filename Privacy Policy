### 2.4 Mobile Device Access
We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device’s calendar, contacts, storage, and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.

Device information such as your mobile device ID number, model, and manufacturer, version of your operating system, phone number, country, location, and any other data you choose to provide.

### 2.6 Third-Party Data
Information from third parties, such as personal information or network friends, if you connect your account to the third party and grant the App permission to access this information.

Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:
- Create and manage your account.
- Provide and manage services.
- Process your transactions.
- Email you regarding your account or order.
- Compile anonymous statistical data and analysis for use internally or with third parties.
- Deliver targeted advertising, newsletters, and other information regarding promotions and the App to you.
- Improve and develop the App, and for our own internal marketing and demographic studies, to analyze customer behavior.

## 4. Disclosure of Your Information
We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:
- **By Law or to Protect Rights.** If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.
- **Business Transfers.** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
- **Third-Party Service Providers.** We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.

## 5. Security of Your Information
We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## 6. Data Storage and Encryption on Firebase
We use Firebase to store your data securely. Firebase employs industry-standard security measures to protect your information, including:
- **Data Encryption.** All data transmitted between the App and Firebase is encrypted using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).
- **Database Encryption.** Data stored in Firebase is encrypted at rest, ensuring that your data is protected even when it is not being transmitted.
- **Access Control.** Firebase enforces strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the data. Each user has a unique User ID, and administrators access data using a secure admin passkey.

## 7. Policy for Children
We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

## 8. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

## 9. Options Regarding Your Information
You may at any time review or change the information in your account or terminate your account by:
- Logging into your account settings and updating your account.

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.
